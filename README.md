John the Ripper: Password Cracking & Security Analysis
An ICT Project on Password Security & Cracking Techniques

This project explores password security and ethical password cracking using John the Ripper (JtR), a powerful open-source tool designed for detecting weak passwords. The goal is to demonstrate how password hashing works, the importance of strong passwords, and how attackers exploit weak credentials.

üî• Features
Hash Cracking ‚Äì Supports a wide range of hash types (MD5, SHA-256, NTLM, etc.)
Wordlist & Brute Force Attacks ‚Äì Tests passwords against common wordlists and permutations
Optimized Performance ‚Äì Uses multi-threading and GPU acceleration (with Jumbo versions)
Password Policy Auditing ‚Äì Helps organizations enforce stronger password security
‚ö° Setup & Usage
Install John the Ripper on a compatible system
Provide a hash file or password-protected archive
Choose a cracking method (dictionary attack, brute force, etc.)
Run john <hashfile> and analyze the results
üîê Ethical Considerations
This project is for educational and security research purposes only. Cracking passwords without permission is illegal and unethical. The goal is to highlight the importance of secure password practices.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Automating password strength analysis in corporate environments
Implementing AI-based pattern recognition for smarter cracking techniques
